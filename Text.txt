Complete project structure and understanding Structure for End to End Data Science Projects (For Production)

Reference - 

1. Create Virtual Environment: Virtual Environment for separate projects

2. Create Requirements.txt file: To install libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas)

3. Create setup.py file: Whenever we want to convert the whole project into the packages

4. Creating notebooks folder: it's just for to do our EDA purpose. 

5. Creating a project name folder: My entire machine learning life cycle should be run inside this folder. Whenever we create a folder, we should always create an init.py file. Because this source folder is also a package, we should be able to reuse it and install it somewhere else.We should create the below files and folders inside the source file.

(i) __init__.py - To convert this folder into a package

(ii) exception.py - To handle the exceptions

(iii) logger.py - To create a log file

(iv) utils.py -utils.py file basically means any generic functionality probably that I want to create for this

entire project.

(v) Components Folder

(vi) __init__.py file (inside components folder) - To

convert this component folder into a package (vi) data_ingestion.py file (inside components folder)

- To extract the dataset from databases or

somewhere else

(vi) data_transformation.py file (inside components

folder) - To do feature engineering

(vii) model_trainer.py file (inside components folder) -

To create a model

(ix) Pipeline Folder (inside source folder) - This folder is for training the model and predicting the model.

(x) training_pipeline.py file (inside pipeline folder) - evaluating the model

(xi) predict_pipeline.py file (inside pipeline folder) -

predicting for test data or new data

6. Artifacts folder - This folder will create by code not manually, this folder is for saving our outputs.

7. Logs - To saving the log details and this folder will create by code not manually.

8. app.py - To create a web application for our model
9. templates folder
Containes html file for rendering 
10. Dockerfile - To deploy in the cloud.
